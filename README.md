# CLDV6211Tutorial_Part3Demo

This is a basic ASP.NET Core MVC application demonstrating database integration using SQL Server and Entity Framework Core. It serves as a working example that students can use as a starting point for cloud-based projects.

## Features

- Basic MVC structure with Home, Venues and Privacy views
- SQL Server database connection using Entity Framework Core
- Example of a data model and controller using local SQL Server
- Uses default layout and routing

Please note that I did not use Azure. This is a very basic example of how to implement Advanced filtering in your MVC App.
